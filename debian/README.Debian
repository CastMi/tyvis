tyvis for Debian
----------------
Tyvis has undergone major changes since the last release.  It is now
linked against a completely rewritten warped, which exists in the Debian
packages libwarped0 and libwarped0-dev.  See the README.Debian in the
Savant package for more info about how to simulate VHDL using
Savant/Tyvis/Warped.  API documentation for TyVis is at
<http://www.cliftonlabs.com/savant/docs/tyvis/html/>.
